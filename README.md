### Why this exists

The original **Art Class** project (github.com/art-class/v4) officially shut down and stopped all development on **March 2, 2025**.  
They announced:  
> "Art Class has officially shut down and stopped development as of March 2nd, 2025. Thank you all for being a part of this. Feel free to fork this and host it yourself, but this repo will no longer be maintained."

This LTS version picks up where they left off:
- Fixing broken games and patching vulnerabilities
- Staying completely **ad-free**
- Ongoing maintenance and community-driven updates
- Hosted permanently on Vercel at **https://art-class-proxy.vercel.app**

No plans to monetize or add ads—pure community revival.

### Features (same core as original v4)
- Tons of unblocked games
- Apps & utilities
- Built-in proxy
- Emulator section
- Clean dashboard & search

### How to self-host / contribute
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/walktheearth/Art-Class-Proxy.git
   cd Art-Class-Proxy
